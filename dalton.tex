\subsection{Dalton's Atomic Theory}

The discovery of something so much smaller than the lightest atom threw Dalton's atomic theory out the window.
His theory claimed that  everything in the universe was made up of atoms which would vary in size and mass based on the element.
These atoms could not be created or destroyed, but  could reaarrange themselves through chemical reactions.
It could be argued that Dalton's model was a progenitor for the idea of conservation of mass and energy.
Despite being such an important idea, even before the discovery of electrons, the theory wasn't fullproof; it could not account for isotopes of the same element having different masses, but the electron blew the idea wide apart.

A new theory that looked at the atom not as the smallest thing that could exist but rather something that had other things inside in some sort of structure had to be developed.
