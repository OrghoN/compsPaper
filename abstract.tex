The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will address open issues in neutrino physics such as the measurement of the CP-violating phase in neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering.
The 2x2 demonstrator is a single-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC), with four modules, operated as a prototype for the DUNE Liquid Argon Near Detector (ND-LAr).
Based on the ArgonCube design concept, the 2x2 features a novel pixelated charge readout and advanced high-coverage photon detection system.

Machine learning (specifically the SPINE package) can be used to form a complete reconstruction pipeline of the 2x2 events.
This paper will describe the workings on this reconstruction and its current performance.
