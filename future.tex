\section{Future Steps towards a PhD}

I believe it is highly unlikely that DUNE will gather reasonable amounts of data that a physics analysis can be performed on in the next couple of years.
So, I wish to take a look at data that has already been gathered at NOVA.
The hope is to extend the analysis that Sarah Choate is working on that tries to detect  the anomolous magnetic moment of a neutrino.
\footnote{Physics beyond the standard model}
It entails looking for a low energy final state electron.
Currently there is a CNN that has been trained to identify electrons, but that was trained on standard model data and has difficulty distinguishing between Michel electrons and the final state electrons that result from the hypothetical coupling of the muon neutrino to a photon.

I believe the work done on DUNE on machine learning based reconstruction leaves me in a good position to work on the problem of improving reconstruction at the low energy regime for NOVA despite it being a scintillator based detector rather than a LArTPC.
With improved reconstruction, the analysis performed in the $0.5GeV$  should lead to a more precise result.
