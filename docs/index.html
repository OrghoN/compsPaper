<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >      People working in the field of high energy physics have a tendency to concern themselves with
attempting to solve problems that are incredibly complicated. So, perhaps, there is a touch
of irony that the problem that they are trying to solve is not only incredibly fundamental,
but also very simple to state. The question can be boiled down to &#8211; what is the stuff in our
universe made of? What immediately follows from this fundamental inquiry is how is matter
made up of these things ; or to put it another way, how do the fundamental building blocks
interact.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >      In some sense particle physics tries to distill matter and the interactions therein down to the
smallest possible level to which it can be broken down. Turns out that breaking these concepts down to
this elementary level of specificity is an incredibly complicated process of which we have merely begun to
scratch the surface. As such,this paper focuses on a tiny fraction of these fundamental building blocks &#8211;
the elusive neutrino with the hope of just perhaps being able to untangle some of the myriad of secrets that
it harbours.

of our story - the neutrino - can be formally introduced, the stage has to be set. A good candidate to set the
stage would be the standard model which describesthree of the four known fundamental forces,
electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions (it struggles to deal with gravity) and classifying all known
elementary particles. Just like any foundational theory that undergirds a subfield of a subject, the standard
model definitely wasn&#8217;t developed in a day and as such, it may behoove us to at least go over the high
points ofits development in order to have a better understanding of the context that surrounds
neutrinos.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >      One may definitely quibble about where our understanding of the fundamental particles starts from,
after all, humans have been trying to find out the nature of our universe and the things that make it up
going back as far as the 4th century BCE with Plato positing that everything is made up of 4 elements
(water, wind, earth and fire)[<a 
href="#XTimaeus">1</a>] but I think it makes sense to start at the discovery of the first of
the particles that made it&#8217;s way into the pantheon of the standard model; the electron. For
the longest time, humans had thought that atoms were the smallest particle that makes up
everything in the world and cannot be subdivided further[<a 
href="#XDalton">2</a>] but this idea had started to come
under scrutiny by the late 1800&#8217;s. Even then, it was thought that if anything were to make up
atoms, they would n&#8217;t be lighter than the lightest atom. However, in 1897, Thomson would
come in with evidence that there not only were particles that made up the atoms, but that
they were on the scale of 1000 times lighter than hydrogen. He decided to shoot cathode rays
at a thermal junction so he could measure the generated heat and neasured how much they
deflectedmagnetically. He also measured the electrical deflections by lowering the pressure in the chamber
where he was measuring the deflection. Through these experiments, discovered the electron
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5003f2"></a> and
believed that it was a fundamental part of all atoms that was very light and held a decidedly negative
charge.[<a

<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >      A decision tree is where we sort the data by asking a sequence of questions and following the
flowchart down to where it leads. By the time we are at the bottom of the tree and have classified the data
we can say exactly how the model does it&#8217;s classification. For instance if a decision tree is used for
mortgage decisions and the model says no, we can query and learn that it said no because you had too low
income or too low credit score for instance.

<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >      By contrast, a machine learning model like a neural net is almost a black box with regards to how
the decisions are made. We can query the model and ask it what it made its decisions based on, however,
the features it picks out often isn&#8217;t decipherable to humans in any way. As in the previous example, if the
answer to a mortgage is no, we have no real idea why the model made that decision. That
being said, neural networks are often able to come up with better outcomes for classification
that simple models like decision trees are. In the mortgage example, even if the neural net
can&#8217;t tell us how it comes to the conclusion of approving a loan, it is still more likely to be
able to better tell who will be a good credit risk compared to the decision tree. That&#8217;s often
the trade off that we make when deciding on a more opaque model. That&#8217;s why even though
they are opaque in how they come up with their answers we still rely on them so heavily.
Because we can empirically test through monte-carlo studies how well they perform both in term
of efficiency as well as how often these models misidentify the data that we are throwing at
it.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >      While a neural network is opaque about how the decisions are made, the model itself doesn&#8217;t have
to be a black box for us. We can take a peek under the hood and see how these models work. To do so, we
start up from the basic models like a perceptron and work our way to a graph neural network, finally
connecting it to how neutrino reconstruction works.
