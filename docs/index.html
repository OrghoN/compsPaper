<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >      People working in the field of high energy physics have a tendency to concern themselves with
attempting to solve problems that are incredibly complicated. So, perhaps, there is a touch
of irony that the problem that they are trying to solve is not only incredibly fundamental,
but also very simple to state. The question can be boiled down to &#8211; what is the stuff in our
universe made of? What immediately follows from this fundamental inquiry is how is matter
made up of these things ; or to put it another way, how do the fundamental building blocks
interact.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >      In some sense particle physics tries to distill matter and the interactions therein down to the
smallest possible level to which it can be broken down. Turns out that breaking these concepts down to
this elementary level of specificity is an incredibly complicated process of which we have merely begun to
scratch the surface. As such,this paper focuses on a tiny fraction of these fundamental building blocks &#8211;
the elusive neutrino with the hope of just perhaps being able to untangle some of the myriad of secrets that
it harbours.

of our story - the neutrino - can be formally introduced, the stage has to be set. A good candidate to set the
stage would be the standard model which describesthree of the four known fundamental forces,
electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions (it struggles to deal with gravity) and classifying all known
elementary particles. Just like any foundational theory that undergirds a subfield of a subject, the standard
model definitely wasn&#8217;t developed in a day and as such, it may behoove us to at least go over the high
points ofits development in order to have a vetter understanding of the context that surrounds
neutrinos.
