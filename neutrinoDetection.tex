\section{Neutrino Detection}

The detection of neutrinos is a crucial aspect of understanding nuclear reactions and the fundamental structure of matter.
Ongoing research aims to further understand their properties, including their masses, their role in the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry, and potential new physics beyond the Standard Model.
