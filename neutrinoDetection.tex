\section{Neutrino Detection}

The detection of neutrinos is a crucial aspect of understanding nuclear reactions and the fundamental structure of matter.
The discovery of neutrino oscillations not only confirmed that neutrinos have mass but also opened up new avenues for research, such as the precise determination of the neutrino mass spectrum and the investigation of the potential for CP violation in the lepton sector.
Ongoing research aims to further understand their properties, including their masses, their role in the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry, and potential new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In order to study them experimentally, we have to actually be able to detect them -- a task made complicated by the fact that neutrinos only interact with the weak force.
Trillions of neutrinos go through us humans every second and we don't notice because they don't really interact with us, instead passing right through.
