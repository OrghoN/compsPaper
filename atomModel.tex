\subsection{Models of the Atom}

The discovery of something so much smaller than the lightest atom threw Dalton's atomic theory out the window.
His theory claimed that  everything in the universe was made up of atoms which would vary in size and mass based on the element.
These atoms could not be created or destroyed, but  could reaarrange themselves through chemical reactions.
It could be argued that Dalton's model was a progenitor for the idea of conservation of mass and energy.
Despite being such an important idea, even before the discovery of electrons, the theory wasn't fullproof; it could not account for isotopes of the same element having different masses, but the electron blew the idea wide apart.

A new theory that looked at the atom not as the smallest thing that could exist but rather something that had other things inside in some sort of structure had to be developed.

There were numerous models that tried to tackle this problem and one of the first was proposed by Thompson in 1904 as the plum pudding model.
The first problem to grapple with was that electrons are negatively charged while the atoms themselves are electrically neutral.
To get around this, the plum pudding model suggests that  the electrons were suspended in a morass of positively charged particles
\footnote{Kind of like plums suspended in a pudding, hence the name of the model}
with the charge between the positive  and negative equalling out to 0.
Thomson believed that the mass was evenly distributed throughout the atom.

The plum pudding model struggled to explain how these charged particles were so copacetic with each other despite being such small physical distances apart.
It was well known by then that opposite charges attract while alike charges repel.
It also failed to provide any explanation of the spectral lines observed in hydrogen.
Darker clouds were still on the horizon for Thomson's plum pudding model.

Between 1908 and  1913, a number of alpha ($\alpha$) particle scattering experiments were performed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.
These took the form of shooting $\alpha$  particles at a  incredibly thin piece of gold foil.
Based on the plum pudding model, it was expected that the $\alpha$ particles would not be deflected however this turned out not to be the case at all.
To be fair, most of the $\alpha$ particles did indeed go straight through the gold foil, their trajectory not disturbed in the slightest.
A smaller fraction did get deflected, some by a small angle and others by a large one.
But the astonishing part was that an even smaller fraction, about 1 in 20000, shot right back at the direction the particle gun was shooting from.

So a new model was required to explain the discrepencies away; in comes Rutherford.
He looked at the gold foil experiments done before him and ran with it, expanding upon them and developing a new theory on the substructure of the atom.
He proposed in 1911 that atoms were mostly just empty spacewith a highly concentrated segment of mass at the center of the atom -- he called this central mass the neucleus of the atom.
In Rutherford's atomic model, the electrons orbit around the positively charged neucleus.

Only, one little problem.
When things move in a circular orbit, they are accelerating and when a charged particle is moving in an orbit like that,  it should be constantly radiating energy leading to it eventually falling into the neucleus rendering this formulation of the atom unstable.
It should also be emitting a continous energy spectrum from the electrons, but hydrogen has discrete spectral lines.

Bohr tried to come at this from an angle that resolved the spectral line issue with Rutherford's model.
Bohr proposed that electrons move in fixed orbits, thus explaining the discrete lines of the hydrogen spectra and that atoms emit light when an electron jumps from a higher energy level to a lower one.

\end{figure}

This still doesn't explain away why the electron doesn't collapse into the neucleus .
However, it does a very good job of modelling hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms under most normal conditions.
The other issue with Bohr's model is that it fails to adress De-Broglieâ€™s Hypothesis of the dual nature of matter..
To get there, we have to delve into the wonderful world of quantum mechanics.
