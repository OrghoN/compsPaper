\subsection{Particle Identification}

Now that things are clustered properly, we move on to do particle identification like in figure \ref{pidEvent}.

This is done through the Graph Partitioning and Aggregation (GrapPa GNN.GrapPa innovates by combining partitioning and aggregation techniques to handle massive graphs efficiently.
It first partitions the input graph into smaller, manageable subgraphs, ensuring that computational resources are allocated more effectively.
These partitions are then processed independently through GNN layers, which helps in capturing local graph structures without overwhelming the system's memory.
The aggregation step combines the results from these subgraphs, allowing the model to capture global dependencies and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the entire graph's topology.
This approach strikes a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, making it particularly useful for applications with large and complex graph data.

The GrapPa framework also integrates advanced techniques such as hierarchical pooling and dynamic batching to further enhance its scalability and performance.
Hierarchical pooling enables the model to learn and propagate information across different levels of graph granularity, while dynamic batching adjusts the processing load according to the current computational demands.
These features contribute to GrapPa's ability to generalize well across various graph sizes and structures, addressing key limitations of traditional GNNs which often struggle with scalability and efficiency.

GrapPa tries not only to identify the individual particles but also runs a binary classifier to see if the particle is a primary or secondary.
